# etch-a-sketch
Project for the course - making an etch a sketch drawing app

In this project made for Odin project fundamentals course, I will use javascript, html and css. The main focus will be on DOM manipulation in order to demonstrate everything learned so far. It will also use a fair number of other methods not learned before but reseaching and acquiring knowledge on the get go.
